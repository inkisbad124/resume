<h1>About Me</h1> <hr />

<p>My name is Kara Meyers. I have just started my courses in Web Development 
  and very excited to see where this will get me in life. I have always been
  interested in Web Development and coding. My family always told me that I 
  would be really good working in a field like this.</p>
<p>A little about me: <br />
  I am 25 years young, born and raised in Prescott, Arizona. I love the outdoors
  whether it be hiking, camping, hunting or fishing. I have been in the fishkeeping
  hobby for just over a year, the fish I keep currently are Corydora Catfish,
  Mollies, Chinese Algae Eaters, Nerite Snails and a Betta. I also enjoy making 
  tie-dye shirts and tapestries, it is so fascinating how each project comes out 
  so unique and different.</p> <hr />
